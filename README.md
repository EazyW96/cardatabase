# Full Stack Development with Spring Boot 3 and React

## Overview

This project is part of my journey to learn full stack web development using Java, Spring Boot 3, React, and TypeScript. By following the book "Full Stack Development with Spring Boot 3 and React - Fourth Edition" by Juha Hinkula, I aim to build modern web applications that integrate a robust backend with an interactive frontend.

## Learning Objectives

- **Backend Development with Spring Boot 3**: Understand how to create RESTful web services, manage databases using JPA and Hibernate, implement security measures with Spring Security and JWTs, and perform backend testing.

- **Frontend Development with React and TypeScript**: Learn the fundamentals of React, utilize TypeScript for type safety, consume REST APIs, manage state and props, and incorporate third-party components like Material UI.

- **Full Stack Integration**: Develop skills to integrate the frontend and backend seamlessly, implement CRUD functionalities, style applications effectively, conduct testing, secure the application, and deploy using platforms like AWS and Docker.

## Purpose of Using Git

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in your code over time. It allows for efficient collaboration, version tracking, and code management. By using Git in this project, I can:

- **Version Control**: Maintain a history of code changes, enabling easy reversion to previous states if necessary.

- **Collaboration**: Facilitate collaboration with other developers by managing code contributions and integrating changes seamlessly.

- **Backup**: Ensure that code is safely backed up in remote repositories, preventing data loss.

- **Showcase Progress**: Demonstrate my learning journey and project development to potential employers or collaborators.

Utilizing Git enhances my development workflow and provides a platform to showcase my work effectively. 

## Repository Structure

- **/backend**: Contains the Spring Boot 3 application, including all Java source files, configuration, and resources.

- **/frontend**: Houses the React application with TypeScript, including components, styles, and assets.

- **/docs**: Documentation related to the project, such as setup instructions, design decisions, and learning notes.

## Getting Started

To set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fullstack-springboot-react.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the backend directory and build the Spring Boot application**:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

3. **Navigate to the frontend directory, install dependencies, and start the React application**:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

4. **Access the application**: Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the running application.
